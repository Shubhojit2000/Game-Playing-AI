# ♟️ Havannah AI – Game Playing Agent with Minimax & Alpha-Beta Pruning

This project implements a Game Playing AI for the board game Havannah. The AI uses the Minimax algorithm with Alpha–Beta pruning to make intelligent, time-bounded decisions. It supports playing against a human or a random-move opponent, and can detect all Havannah winning conditions — Bridge, Fork, and Ring.

## 🎯 Game Rules
Players alternate turns, placing their colored pieces on empty cells of the board.A player wins if they form any one of the following:
- Bridge – A continuous chain connecting any two of the six corners.
- Fork – A chain connecting three different edges (edges do not include corners).
- Ring – A closed loop of pieces enclosing at least one cell (can be empty or occupied).
